Project Name: Car Listing Web Application  
Live URL: https://car-project-1-yhxo.onrender.com  
Tech Stack: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS (if frontend included), Render (deployment)

Description:
This is a web-based car listing platform where users can view, add, and manage car details. The project showcases a RESTful API (and possibly a frontend) that handles various car-related functionalities including:

- Viewing a list of available cars
- Adding new cars with details and image URLs
- Viewing individual car details
- Updating or deleting car entries (admin only)

Key Features:
- Django REST Framework used for building APIs
- PostgreSQL for robust relational data handling
- Image support via URLs
- Hosted on Render with a live demo link
- Clean and modular codebase for scalability

API Endpoints (examples):
- `GET /cars/` – List all cars
- `GET /cars/<id>/` – Retrieve a single car
- `POST /cars/` – Add a new car
- `PUT /cars/<id>/` – Update a car
- `DELETE /cars/<id>/` – Delete a car

Authentication:
(Optional section – include if login/auth is required)

Future Improvements:
- Add user authentication and permissions
- Upload images instead of using image URLs
- Implement frontend UI with React or Django Templates
- Filter and search options for cars
- Add pagination and sorting
